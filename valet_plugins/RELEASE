Valet1.0/Ostro features

- Optimal VM placement
    Use the decent algorithm, compute the holistic optimal placement for all VMs of given application. Working on NUMAAffinityFilter and PCIPassthroughFilter.

- Constraint solving (filtering)
    Current constraints (i.e., filters) include CoreFilter, RamFilter, DiskFilter, host aggregates, availability zones. Possibly, the decision making of Ostro is different from Nova when tenant attempts to use other filters available in Nova. In this case, Ostro yields its decision to Nova scheduler unless the tenant uses affinity, diversity, and exclusivity in Heat template. However, we will restrict some Nova filters if it affects cloud security, reliability, and efficiency. 

- Affinity, Diversity, and Exclusivity in either host or rack level
    In addition of the above filters, support affinity, diversity (anti-affinity), and exclusivity. The rack level can be supported when the topology/layout information of site is available. Currently, use the host machine naming convention. If a site does not follow the naming convention, the rack level request will be rejected. Note that you can use the mix of these special filters and the basic filters.

- Resource standby
    When allocating resources (CPU, memory, disk, and later network bandwidth), Ostro intentionally leaves a certain percentage of resources as unused. This is because of the concern of load spikes of tenant applications. Later, we will deploy more dynamic mechanism in the future version of Ostro.

- Runtime update via the Oslo message bus or RO
