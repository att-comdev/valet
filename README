ASSUMPTIONS 

- The physical hierarchy of datacenter (AIC site) is up to 3 layers, i.e., host, rack, and cluster. Here, the cluster can be availability zone.
- The power domain is per rack base.
- Up to 3-level networking hierarchy, i.e., host, top of rack switch (ToR), and spine
- Remote storage I/O between host and storage is shared with other normal networking transmissions


INSTALLATION

0. Install Canssandra Python driver if needed

	pip install cassandra-driver

(assume your machine has ‘pip’ installed; otherwise download src from flask.pocoo.org and install manually)

1. Install Cassandra (single node)

Download Cassandra (version 2.2.0 or above) from: http://cassandra.apache.org/download/
Unzip installation file in any directory (for example, /home/)
In the installation directory, go to subdirectory: conf/
Change configurations in file cassandra.yaml (assume your public ip is 135.207.143.212):

	Cluster_name: ’your_cluster_name’
	Initial_token: 0
	- seeds: “135.207.143.212”
	listen_address: localhost
	broadcast_address: 135.207.143.212
	rpc_address: localhost

Refer: https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted


USAGE

0. Configure Ostro

Set authentication in code/ostro_server/ostro.auth file.

Set all other configurations in code/ostro_server/ostro.cfg file such as logging, OpenStack Keystone and Nova API addresses.

1. Start Cassandra

Go to Cassandra installation directory and type:

	sudo bin/cassandra start

If you want to use the command line tool to interact with it, type:

	sudo bin/cqlsh

you can use this cqlsh to create a key_space (similar to session) in Cassandra by typing:

CREATE KEYSPACE ostro_v_2_0_0
WITH REPLICATION = {‘class’:’SimpleStrategy’,’replication_factor’:1};

This will only be required once.

2. Start/stop Ostro daemon

Go to code/ostro_server, then start Ostro daemon.

	python ostro_daemon.py start

To stop this daemon process:

	python ostro_daemon.py stop
