This directory is to contain the version of Valet intended for
open source release under the OpenStack Big Tent. It uses Ceilometer
as a baseline model of CLI/API/Engine architecture, and matches on
the API front (both use Pecan).

In the process of renaming things to use valet, note that the
.rst and .po files have not been altered.
