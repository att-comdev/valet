# valet-api

Valet gives OpenStack the ability to optimize cloud resources while simultaneously meeting a cloud application's QoS requirements. Valet provides an api service, an optimizer (Ostro), and a set of OpenStack plugins.

This document covers installation of valet-api, the API engine used to interact with Valet.

**IMPORTANT**: [Overall AT&T AIC Installation of Valet is covered in a separate document](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/allegro/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/doc/aic/README.md). These instructions are to be used by the Bedminster and Tel Aviv development teams.

## Prerequisites

Prior to installation:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Python 2.7.6 with pip
* An OpenStack Kilo cloud
* [Music](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/music/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/README.md) 6.0
* [Ostro](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/ostro/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/README) 2.0

### A Note About Python Virtual Environments

It is recommended to install and configure valet-api within a python [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (venv), This helps avoid instabilities and conflicts within the default python environment.

## Download

valet-api is maintained in AT&T CodeCloud under the CloudQoS project, in a repository called 'allegro'.

*Note: Apart from the repository name, the word 'Allegro' is no longer used. Use the word 'Valet' in place of 'Allegro' when referring to components.*

Clone the git repository from AT&T CodeCloud, using an account with appropriate credentials.

```bash
$ git clone https://$CODECLOUD_USER@codecloud.web.att.com/scm/st_cloudqos/allegro.git

```

## Installation

Install valet-api on a host that can reach all OpenStack Keystone endpoints (public, internal, and admin). This can be a controller node or a separate host. Likewise, valet-api, Ostro, and Music may be installed on the same host or separate hosts.

valet-api is located in ``valet_api``.

```bash
$ cd $VALET_API_PATH
$ sudo pip install .
```

If the following error appears when installing valet-api, and SSL access is required (e.g., if Keystone can only be reached via SSL), use a newer Python 2.7 Ubuntu package.

```bash
[InsecurePlatformWarning](https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning): A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail.
```

## User Account

Create an Ubuntu user/group for the valet service user (usually ``valet``):

```bash
$ sudo adduser --gecos "valet service user" valet
```

If the Ubuntu-assigned uid/gid requires adjustment:

```bash
$ sudo usermod -u $DESIRED_ID -U valet
$ sudo groupmod -g $DESIRED_ID valet
```

## Configuration

Copy ``$VALET_API_PATH/etc/valet_api/config.py`` to a suitable configuration path (``$VALET_CONFIG_PATH``) outside of the CodeCloud git repository prior to editing. (Always edit the copy, never the original.) As the config file will contain sensitive passwords, ``$VALET_CONFIG_PATH`` must have limited visibility and be accessible only to the user running valet-api.

Edit the following sections in the ``config.py`` copy. See the [valet-openstack README](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/allegro/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/valet_os/README.md) for additional context around the ``server`` and ``identity`` sections.

*Note: In OpenStack parlance, Valet is canonically referred to as a **placement service**.*

### Server

* Set ``port`` to match the port number used by OpenStack Keystone's placement service (usually ``8090``).
* ``host`` can remain ``0.0.0.0``.

```python
server = {
    'port': '8090',
    'host': '0.0.0.0'
}
```

### Identity

* Set ``username`` and ``password`` to the OpenStack placement service user.
* Set ``project_name`` to the OpenStack placement service user's tenant name.
* Set ``auth_url`` to the OpenStack Keystone API publicurl endpoint.

```python
identity = {
    'config': {
        'username': '$VALET_USERNAME',
        'password': '$VALET_PASSWORD',
        'project_name': '$VALET_TENANT_NAME',
        'auth_url': '$KEYSTONE_AUTH_API',
    }
}
```

Once authenticated via Keystone's *publicurl* endpoint, valet-api uses Keystone's *adminurl* endpoint for further API calls. Access to the adminurl endpoint is required for:

* Authentication (AuthN) of OpenStack users for valet-api access.
* Authorization (AuthZ) of OpenStack users for valet-api access. This is presently limited to users assigned an ``admin`` role.
* Obtaining a list of all OpenStack cloud tenants (used by Valet Groups).

*Note: Formal Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) support (via oslo-policy) is expected in a future release.*

If the Keystone adminurl endpoint is not reachable, Valet will not be able to obtain a complete tenant list. To mitigate:

* Add an additional identity config setting named ``'interface'``, set to ``'public'``.
* In the OpenStack cloud, ensure the valet user (``$VALET_USERNAME``) is a member of every tenant. Keep membership current as needed.

### Messaging

* Set ``transport_url`` to match the OpenStack Oslo Messaging Service endpoint.

```python
messaging = {
    'config': {
        'transport_url': 'rabbit://$OSLO_MSG_USERNAME:$OSLO_MSG_PASSWORD@$OSLO_MSG_HOST:5672/',
    }
}
```

### Music

* Set ``host``, ``port``, ``keyspace``, and ``replication_factor`` as needed for access to Music.
* Alternately, set ``hosts`` (plural form) to a python list of hosts if more than one host is used (e.g., ``'[host1, host2, host3]'``).

For example, if Music is hosted on ``127.0.0.1`` port ``8080`` with a keyspace of ``valet`` and replication factor of ``3``:

```python
music = {
    'host': '127.0.0.1',
    'port': '8080',
    'keyspace': 'valet',
    'replication_factor': 3,
}
```

*Notes: If ``host`` and ``hosts`` are both set, ``host`` is used and ``hosts`` is ignored. Music does not use AuthN or AuthZ at this time.*

## Data Storage Initialization

Use the ``pecan populate`` command to initialize data storage:

```bash
$ pecan populate $VALET_CONFIG_PATH/config.py
```

Any previously created tables will be left as-is and not deleted/re-created.

*Note: Music does not support migrations. If necessary, schema changes in future versions will be noted here with specific upgrade instructions.*

## Running for the first time

Use the ``pecan serve`` command to run valet-api and verify installation.

```bash
$ pecan serve $VALET_CONFIG_PATH/config.py
```

Browse to ``http://$VALET_HOST:8090/`` (no AuthN/AuthZ required). Check for a response, for example:

```json
{
    "versions": [
        {
            "status": "CURRENT",
            "id": "v1.0",
            "links": [
                {
                    "href": "http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/",
                    "rel": "self"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

valet-api comes with a [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) collection of sample API calls, located in ``$VALET_API_PATH/valet_api/tests``. [Learn more](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/allegro/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/valet_api/valet_api/tests/README.md).

See the ``doc`` directory for placement service [API documentation](https://codecloud.web.att.com/plugins/servlet/readmeparser/display/ST_CLOUDQOS/allegro/atRef/refs/heads/master/renderFile/valet_api/doc/README.md).

*IMPORTANT: Do not use ``pecan serve`` to run valet-api in a production environment. A number of production-quality WSGI-compatible environments are available (e.g., apache2 httpd).*

## Configuring apache2 httpd

This section describes an example WSGI installation using apache2 httpd.

### Prerequisites

* apache2 httpd
* libapache2-mod-wsgi (3.4 at a minimum, 3.5 recommended by the author)
* A ``valet`` service user account/group on the host where valet-api is installed.

### Configuration

Set up directories and ownership:

```bash
$ sudo mkdir $VALET_CONFIG_PATH
$ sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/valet
$ sudo cp -p $VALET_API_PATH/etc/valet_api/app.wsgi $VALET_API_PATH/etc/valet_api/config.py $VALET_CONFIG_PATH
$ sudo chown -R valet:valet /var/log/apache2/valet $VALET_CONFIG_PATH
```

Set up valet-api as a site:

```bash
$ sudo cd $APACHE2_CONFIG_PATH/sites-available
$ sudo cp -p $VALET_API_PATH/etc/valet_api/app.apache2 valet.conf
$ sudo chown root:root valet.conf
```

*Note: ``$APACHE2_CONFIG_PATH`` may be ``/opt/apache2`` or ``/etc/apache2`` depending on the installation.*

If valet-api was installed in a python virtual environment, append ``python-home=$VENV`` to ``WSGIDaemonProcess`` within ``valet.conf``. Apache will then use the correct python environment and libraries.

Enable valet-api, ensure the configuration syntax is valid, and restart:

```bash
$ cd $APACHE2_CONFIG_PATH/sites-enabled
$ sudo ln -s ../sites-available/valet.conf .
$ sudo apachectl -t
Syntax OK
$ sudo apachectl graceful
```

## Uninstallation

Activate a virtual environment (venv) first if necessary, then uninstall with:

```bash
$ sudo pip uninstall valet-api
```

Remove previously made configuration file changes, OpenStack user accounts, and other settings as needed.
